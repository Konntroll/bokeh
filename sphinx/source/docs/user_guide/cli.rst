Using the command cine
======================

You can produce a wide range of Bokeh outputs programmatically
with functions such as ``output_file`` and ``output_notebook``.
However, this isn't the only way to work with the library. The
``bokeh`` command line tool often offers better flexibility and
makes iteration easier and faster.

See the Reference Guide section :ref:`bokeh.command` for details.
